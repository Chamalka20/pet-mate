3. Add an Android app
4. Download `google-services.json`
5. Place it inside the `app/` directory
6. Enable Authentication and Cloud Firestore

## ☁️ Cloudinary Setup (Image Upload)

PetMate uses **Cloudinary** to upload and manage pet images.

cloudinary.api.key=YOUR_API_KEY
cloudinary.api.secret=YOUR_API_SECRET
```

Example:

```properties

cloudinary.api.key=123456789012345
cloudinary.api.secret=abc123xyz456secret

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

PetMate follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture:

- **Model** → Handles data and business logic
- **View** → Jetpack Compose UI
- **ViewModel** → Manages UI-related data and state

This ensures clean separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.
